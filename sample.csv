question,1,"Consider the function f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}. Find \lim_{x \to 2} f(x).",
answer,1,"When we calculate \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}, we first note that direct substitution gives \frac{0}{0}, which is indeterminate.\\n\\nWe can factor the numerator: \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} = \frac{(x+2)(x-2)}{x-2} = x + 2 for x \neq 2\\n\\nSince the function simplifies to x + 2 for all values except x = 2, and limits only care about values close to 2 (not at 2), we have:\\n\\n\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 2} (x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4",
question,2,"State and explain the Squeeze Theorem for limits.",
answer,2,"The Squeeze Theorem (also called the Sandwich Theorem or Pinching Theorem) states:\\n\\nIf g(x) ≤ f(x) ≤ h(x) for all x in some open interval containing a (except possibly at a itself), and\\n\\n\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \lim_{x \to a} h(x) = L\\n\\nThen \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L as well.\\n\\nIn other words, if a function is "squeezed" between two functions that both approach the same limit, then the middle function must approach that limit too.",
question,3,"What are the properties of limits?",
answer,3,"Key properties of limits include:\\n\\n- Sum Rule: \lim_{x \to a}[f(x) + g(x)] = \lim_{x \to a}f(x) + \lim_{x \to a}g(x)\\n\\n- Product Rule: \lim_{x \to a}[f(x) · g(x)] = \lim_{x \to a}f(x) · \lim_{x \to a}g(x)\\n\\n- Quotient Rule: \lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{x \to a}f(x)}{\lim_{x \to a}g(x)} provided \lim_{x \to a}g(x) \neq 0\\n\\n- Power Rule: \lim_{x \to a}[f(x)]^n = [\lim_{x \to a}f(x)]^n for integer n\\n\\n- Root Rule: \lim_{x \to a}\sqrt[n]{f(x)} = \sqrt[n]{\lim_{x \to a}f(x)} for functions where the limit is positive (for even roots)",
transition,,"Let's practice these concepts with another example",
question,4,"Evaluate \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}",
answer,4,"\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1\\n\\nThis is a fundamental limit in calculus. While it's not obvious by direct substitution (which gives \frac{0}{0}), it can be proven through geometric arguments or using the squeeze theorem.\\n\\nThis limit is used extensively in calculus, particularly in proving the derivative of sine.",
question,5,"What is the definition of continuity at a point?",
answer,5,"A function f(x) is continuous at a point x = a if the following three conditions are met:\\n\\n1. f(a) is defined (the function exists at that point)\\n\\n2. \lim_{x \to a} f(x) exists (the limit exists as x approaches a)\\n\\n3. \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) (the limit equals the function value)\\n\\nIf any of these conditions fail, the function has a discontinuity at x = a."
